    # Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka

    Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka is a managed cloud service that provides a
    streamlined developer experience for building, deploying, and scaling real-time applications in
    hybrid-cloud environments. The combination of seamless operations across distributed
    microservices, large data transfer volumes, and managed operations allows teams to focus on core
    competencies, accelerate time to value and reduce operational cost.

    Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka makes it easy to create, discover, and connect to
    real-time data streams no matter where they are deployed. Streams are a key component for
    delivering real-time experiences and connecting loosely-coupled microservices.
